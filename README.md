# SPADAXsys

#### Description
SPADAXsys (pronunciation: s'padaksis) is an acronym from <b>S</b>moothed <b>PA</b>rticle <b>D</b>yn<b>A</b>mics 
for industrial comple<b>X</b> <b>sys</b>tems. 
It provides C++ APIs for physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics 
and beyond with a meshless computational method using smoothed particle discretization. 


SPADAXsys is a library for multi-physics, multi-resolution smoothed particle dynamics (SPD) simulations. 
Although it is not a standalone application itself, 
many examples designated for the specific type of applications are provided.

#### Software Architecture
SPADAXsys is cross-platform can be compiled and used in Windows, Linux and Apple systems.

#### Installation

The detailed installation instructions for all platforms can be found in the pdf file /tutorials/SPADAXsys.pdf.
